product listing app


To run the application, below are the instructions:

1. Open the HTML File in a Web Browser: Once we've saved the HTML file, we can open it in a web browser like Chrome. This can be done by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with" from the context menu.


2. View the Product Listing App: Once the HTML file is opened in the browser, we should see the Product Listing App interface, including a header with filter options (category filter, price sort, search bar) and a main section displaying the product grid.


3. Interact with the App: We can interact with the app by selecting a category from the filter dropdown, sorting products by price, searching for products by title, etc. The product grid will dynamically update based on our selections.


4. Fetch Data from FakeStoreAPI: The app will fetch product data from the FakeStoreAPI when the page loads. This data includes product details such as title, image, price, etc. The app also fetches categories from the API to populate the category filter dropdown.

5. Filter, Sort, and Search Products: We can use the category filter, price sort, and search bar to filter, sort, and search for products based on our preferences. The product grid will update dynamically to reflect our selections.
